Guitarist and piano technician Jason began studying the guitar at age 11 and attended Temple University’s Esther Boyer College of Music. He studied under the likes of Tom Giacobetti, Terrell Stafford, Bruce Barth, and Joseph Federico. He has worked with many of the area’s top jazz musicians including Larry McKenna, Byron Landham, Akiko Tsuruga, and Mike Boone and has performed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Barnes Museum, Keswick Theater, Center City Jazz Fest, Bethlehem Music Fest, Somers Point Jazz Fest, and Jazz Bridge Concerts.

Recently, Jason has been collaborating with composer/guitarist extraordinaire Steve Giordano-a duo exploring the more interactive possibilities of new original music and time honored standards alike. He can also be seen performing with Skyline, an organ trio led by organist Lucas Brown, supported by drummer Anwar Marshall as well as various combos featuring vocalist Rhenda Fearington. Jason’s recording credits include, the Tap Room Trio’s 2011 release “Live in Time”, Rhenda Fearington’s 2012 release “This Moment’s Sweetness”, and the Somers Point Jazz Society "Artist Member Compilation".
